# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analytics
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Amazon Sales Data Analysis is a process that involves examining and interpreting data related to sales transactions on Amazon's platform. This type of analysis is crucial for businesses and individuals who sell products on Amazon, as it provides valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, market trends, and product effectiveness.</p>

<h2>Importing Dataset </h2>
<p>Import the Python Libraries Such as Pandas , Numpy , Matplotlib and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook. Download the Amazon Sales Dataset from the Kaggle and Import it as a Data Frame in the Jupyter Notebook</p>

<h2>Data Preparation And Data cleaning </h2>
<H3>Data Preparation</H3>
<P>From the imported Dataset , Look out the columns and Data. Take the necessary Data that you want to analyse for visualisation.</P>

<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>In Data Cleaning, Clean the dataset with the duplicate values. These duplicate values can disturb the visualisation process. Renaming the columns with our interest and neglecting the null values in the dataset</p>

<h2>Data Visualizations</h2>
<p>Data Visualization helps us to know the imformation about the data with some Innovative Charts </p>
<h3>Count Plot</h3>
<p>A countplot is a type of bar plot that represents the frequency or count of occurrences for each category in a categorical variable. It is commonly used in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize the distribution of categorical data. When visualizing the sizes of goods, a countplot can be particularly useful to show how many items fall into each size category (e.g., small, medium, large). This allows for a quick assessment of the most common sizes and any potential imbalances in the distribution. The countplot is typically created using libraries like Seaborn, which provides an easy-to-use interface for generating these plots with additional customization options, such as color palettes and orientation.</p>

<h3>Bar Plot</h3>
<p>A bar plot is a versatile visualization tool that displays the relationship between a categorical variable and a numerical variable by representing the data with rectangular bars. When used to show the sizes of goods by their quantity, a bar plot can effectively illustrate how many units of each size are available. Each bar represents a different size category (e.g., small, medium, large), and the height or length of the bar corresponds to the quantity of goods in that size. This allows for easy comparison between different sizes, helping to quickly identify which size has the most or least inventory. Bar plots are particularly useful for visualizing and comparing the quantities of different categories, providing a clear and concise overview of the distribution of goods by size.</p>

<h3> Count Plot with two Datas </h3>
<p>A countplot is an effective visualization tool for displaying the frequency of categories within a categorical variable. When used to show the courier status of goods, a countplot can illustrate how many shipments fall into each status category, such as "In Transit," "Delivered," "Pending," or "Returned." Each bar in the countplot represents a different courier status, with the height or length of the bar indicating the number of goods in that status. This provides a clear and immediate overview of the distribution of goods across different courier statuses, making it easier to identify which statuses are most or least common and to monitor the overall progress of shipments. </p>
